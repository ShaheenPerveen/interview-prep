### Arrays
1. Find the Kth smallest number in an array. ([solution](https://github.com/ankeshanand/interview-prep/blob/master/arrays/quickselect.py))
2. Find the median of an array in linear time. 
([solution](https://github.com/ankeshanand/interview-prep/blob/master/arrays/median.py))
3. Find the majority element of an array. 
4. Given 2 integer arrays, determine if the 2nd array is a rotated version of the 1st array.
  ```Ex. Original Array A={1,2,3,5,6,7,8} Rotated Array B={5,6,7,8,1,2,3}```
  ([solution](https://github.com/ankeshanand/interview-prep/blob/master/arrays/checkrotation.py))
5. Dutch National Flag Problem
6. Rotate an N*N matrix by 90 degrees

### Binary Search
1. Binary Search in a rotated sorted array.
2. Find pivot of rotation in a rotated sorted array.
3. Find the floor value of a key in a sorted array.
4. Find the number of occurences of a key in a sorted array which might contain duplicate elements.


### Dynamic Programming
1. **Min Coin Change Problem:** You are given n types of coin denominations of values v(1) < v(2) < ... < v(n) (all integers). Assume v(1) = 1, so you can always make change for any amount of money C. Give an algorithm which makes change for an amount of money C with as few coins as possible
